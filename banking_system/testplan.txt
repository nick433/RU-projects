-------------TESTPLAN---------------


To use the bank server/client, you need to run both, order does not matter, the client waits for a server. To connect to localhost with the client, make the argument <localhost>. So < ./client localhost>

Once connected, the client can type open with a name < open name >, start with a name, or exit. Once in a customer account session, you can credit, debit, or check your balance. Typing 'finish' will log you out of your account and allow you to do open, start, or exit.

The server can be killed with ^C (ctrl C)
